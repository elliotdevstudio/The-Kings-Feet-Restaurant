This website was formerly used for a restaurant called 'The King's Feet', located in Berkeley, CA, and this current version is a rebuild from scratch that is intended to serve as a front-end example of my work, done manually with HTML5, SASS, and javascript.

CURRENT STATE OF THE PAGE, AND CHALLENGES

So far I've concentrated on getting the homepage fully completed to establish responsiveness and some of the layout patterns, and have pulled in a 7-1 approach to organizing SASS files before moving on to the next pages. While things seem to be working well with this arrangment, the main issue that I plan to address later is to assign breakpoint mixins.

WINS

This has been a great learning experience in better understanding how to work with images, animations, and various layout tools and strategies. Most significantly, the exposure to challenges presented by achieving very nuanced bahavior through media queries, and working out any unintended side-effects, has ehanced my front-end problem solving. I'm looking forward to setting up the gallery page, since that will be one of the most tricky to build!

Thank you for checking out my work-- I'll push more updates as soon as I can!

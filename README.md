This website was formerly used for a restaurant called 'The King's Feet', located in Berkeley, CA, and this current version is a rebuild from scratch that is intended to serve as a front-end example of my work, done manually with HTML5, CSS, and javascript (without use of any CSS frameworks).

CURRENT STATE OF THE PAGE, AND CHALLENGES 

As of the last commit, the focus has been on establishing a fully completed and refined homepage, with a plan to refactor and dry up the code. Flex is so far the major property influencing the layout, and that has proven to cause some issues with content overflow and collapsing margins that are noticeable in responsiveness. While there are a few repeating patterns between the sections like with fonts and background colors, most of the content within each them varies in layout, and that presents a challenge in creating classes that are relatively straighforward to apply for multiple sections. For that reason, I'm condsidering bringing in a CSS framework. I'm familiar with Sass but am interested in learning more about tailwind, so I'm looking into importing that into an existing project very soon to try it out. 

SOLUTIONS AND NEXT STEPS

I plan on working with grid layout in at least a couple areas after some more responsiveness testing. The footer and it's content, the navbar, and at least one of the red sections might benefit from the use of grid over flex, but I'm realizing the particular scenarios for using one or the other and am sorting that out for this project.  

Ultimately, my deadline for completing this site is January 1st, 2023. Thank you for checking out my work!
